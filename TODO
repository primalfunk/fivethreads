12.27 - Big improvement to city name generation logic, we now pull from a list of real counties in realworld data and use the names of the cities within that county. Very broad range of countries included. Fixed districts not getting colors.
12.30 - Massive overhaul to the UI with some fresh graphics and animations
1.1 (2024) - integrated the graphic 'menu', worked through a lot of placement issues
1.2 - finished Create Spy action, set flashing indicator on menu with different colors

BUGS
- Player Actions don't work in reset game

TODO
- Set up Yellow button in Menu to go "back" in twostep commands to the first step; "refresh" maybe?
- Complete Move Player action; get menu to recognize the valid spy and show it
- Add AI Moves
- Clicking and dragging into a different district should not change the selected district for touch up (UI)
- Add music
- Work in population logic
